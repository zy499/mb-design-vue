    <a-typography-paragraph>
      A design is a plan or specification for the construction of an object or system or for the implementation of an activity or process, or the result of that plan or specification in the form of a prototype, product or process. The verb to design expresses the process of developing a design.
    </a-typography-paragraph>
    <a-typography-paragraph>
      In some cases, the direct construction of an object without an explicit prior plan (such as in craftwork, some engineering, coding, and graphic design) may also be considered <a-typography-text bold>to be a design activity.</a-typography-text>
    </a-typography-paragraph>
    <a-typography-title :heading="2">MbDesign</a-typography-title>
    <a-typography-paragraph>
      The MbDesign component library defines a set of default particle variables, and a custom theme is to <a-typography-text mark>customize</a-typography-text> and <a-typography-text underline>overwrite</a-typography-text> this variable list.
